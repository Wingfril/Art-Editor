Notes

Need to find a way for user to zoom and rotate the canvas.



6/24/17

We can now pass UI images between segues; curimage is the current user inputed image.

No longer crashing when going back and selecting a new image

Added print statements in the first view to see where we are at a given time.

Need to figure out how to naturally scale the picture, as opposed to forcibly stretching it to fit the UIImageView.


6/25/17

Zooming is now possible.

Image fits to imageview with the largest length touching edge of imageview.

ERROR: The image zooms really tiny and disappears when both fingers are outside of the image (but still inside imageview and scroll view) when zooming.
